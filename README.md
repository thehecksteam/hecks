# hecks

Hecks is a suite of tools for developing Domains and using them with Hexagonal Architecture. The goal is to lower the barrier to using these methodologies and to deliver changeable, testable, maintainable code quickly!

## Usage
`gem install hecks`

## Quick Start
1. Write a domain file
1. Generate a domain
1. Write a command
1. Publish the domain as a gem
1. Configure and use a storage adapter
1. Use the domain in a Rails App

## Hecks Domain
A DSL for generating a ruby application that mirrors a Domain Driven Design
## Hecks App
A framework for injecting adapters into a Domain generated by Hecks Domain
## HecksAdapters
Driver and Driven adapters that can be used in production apps with a Domain generated from Hecks Domain
### DynamoDB adapter
Adapt your domain to easily work with Amazon's DynamoDB
## HecksActiveModel
This decorates domain objects to look like Active Record.  Use the domain you generate with rails helpers like #form_with
## HecksExamples
These examples exercise the DDD concepts.  They are working apps that you can review to understand how Hecks works
### Soccer Season
A domain that describes soccer matches that could be used to publish fixtures
### Lean Coffee
A domain that describes the agile meeting format called lean coffee
### Lean Coffee Rails
A rails app that uses the lean coffee domain and the dynamodb adapter to present an interface to users
### Pizzeria
A very simple domain to help focus on the concepts of DDD instead of a complex domain
